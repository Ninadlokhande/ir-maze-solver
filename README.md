# ir-maze-solver
An autonomous robot that solves mazes using four infrared (IR) sensor pairs. It detects walls by measuring reflected IR light from sensors on its front, left, and right sides. A microcontroller uses this data to implement a wall-following algorithm, enabling precise navigation around corners to find the exit.
